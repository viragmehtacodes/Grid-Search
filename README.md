 Grid Search

This Flutter application is a grid search tool. Users can:

Define the size of a grid (rows and columns).
Generate a grid filled with random letters.
Search for a specific text string within the grid.
See the found text highlighted in the grid.
Reset the grid and search parameters.
It's a simple but functional tool for practicing or demonstrating basic grid search concepts.
